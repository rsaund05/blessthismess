###### Some Notes - *As of January 2022*
- The app is not yet fully functional, the lastest build only uses predefined user data for demo and testing purposes

###### How to Build
- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` inside the root directory `/blessthismess`
- run `npm start` (or `expo start`) inside same directory to initialize the expo developer tools in browser and start the bundler.
- From the bundler, you can choose what platform to run the app on. Note, my primary platform of interest is iOS, so some things may not work quite as intended on android/web browsers. That is not to say that I am not working on them at all, just that they aren't my hightest priority at the moment.
- Note: If for whatever reason the app fails to build/bundle, try deleting /node_modules and package-lock.json and running npm install --legacy-peer-deps
